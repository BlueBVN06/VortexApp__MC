### Installation
If nothing goes wrong the link to playstore apk will be [**here**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skullzbones.vortexconnect)!

But in case you can't get the app from playstore due to any given reasons then you can also download latest apk from releases - https://github.com/hari01584/VortexApp__MC/releases
Download the apk(from releases) and install the application!

Install the apk (you might have to enable *unknown sources* settings for that!) If downloaded externally(outside playstore)

# Looking for help in (TODO)!
As of how this is, I don't think i can commit that actively to this project, Given the fact that this is all my own work without any money or asset involved and i completely get nothing except your praises and admiration(ty), I can't work that much, But i would love to checkout PR's and even more collaborate with some real developers to improve this application even more!! So if you think you have skills, or you would like to help in its development, Be sure to raise an issue in this repository while mentioning about yourself! Also i made this application out of fun and my motivation to remake something like blockman, But i take no ownership in this project, My vision is to have different people collab and contribute to make even better bug free application, ofcouse i dont mind even if you were to fork and make your own complete different version of this app! Infact i would love to see something like that(So message me with progress and stuff)!!

Anyways, Moving on, if someone would be willing to take some of their time to improve this application, then these might be some major point's we need to work on (Ofcouse you can work on something else as well, Like some new feature! But do mention that in issues first)!!
  - Add profile edit system and a way to retain user, right now all user's are anonymously authenticated and processed! So no retentivity of anything after app uninstalled :()..
  - Rework, rewrite chat API and logic to enable groups and stuff.
  - Better server hosting to allow direct host without going through 3rd party softwares.



### Tech

Vortex Connect uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [libMcServerProxy](https://github.com/hari01584/libMcServerProxy) - Allows app to brodcast custom Server to Minecraft LAN.
* [Ion Async](https://github.com/koush/ion) - Networking library
* [SmoothBottomBar](https://github.com/ibrahimsn98/SmoothBottomBar)- Bottom bar!

And of course Vortex Connect is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/hari01584/VortexApp__MC)
 on GitHub.
